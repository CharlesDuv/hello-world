# hello-world
Let's get started with github!

This readme file explain my goals and wanted achievements in life (short and long term projects, and when I say 'projects', I mean 'life dreeam', which is an anagram of readme file. Think about it.)

I am strating to learn a new programming language called Python. Then I will learn R in order to complete my skills and attend university masters class with flying colors. This is only the begining of a long journey called 'now starts my new life', I hope this journey will be the last, as for my next love, soon, I hope, well, not too soon maybe, I need some rest from love, love has wrenched my life lately, my last life really, but I am not mad about love, I need some, hence soon enough, I guess.
Let's go!
